# Social links profile

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this social links profile and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The users should be able to: 

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.
